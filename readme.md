# Capstone One Project Proposal:

## What goal will your website be designed to achieve?
The goal of this project is to create a website that allows users to explore food or drinks based on their eating style. For example, people will get Japanese food around them within a certain distance if they search Japanese food. 
This app will give the best food suggestion if people don’t know what to eat. 
This application should also include restaurant’s information, such as contact number, address, reviews, open hours, and so on. 
Allows user to order food online

## What kind of users will visit your site? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?
The target users of this application are within a wide range. People at any age as long as they would like to try something new and enjoy their food.  For example, users could be: 
Travellers who would like to try the best local food. 
Students who would like to try all of the best restaurant around their campus
People who out of work and enjoy a time with friends
People who just want to find a quiet coffee shop to study
Foodies

## What data do you plan on using? You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain.
Data could be:
Food category
Restaurant’s name, phone number, open hours, reviews, ratings, and pictures
Recommended restaurant based on the food categories
Recommended restaurant shown on the home page based on user’s eating style
Google map api used to guide user to the restaurant
